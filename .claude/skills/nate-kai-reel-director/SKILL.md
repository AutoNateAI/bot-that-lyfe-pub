description: Produce a Nate & Kai 9:16 vertical video (Reel/TikTok/Short) from an existing Bot That Lyfe research article, using the character-engine pipeline's `--format reel` path. Use this whenever the user asks for a reel, a short, a vertical video, a TikTok, or a 9:16 cut of an article — or says "the reel one" after already having a YouTube cut. Builds directly on the nate-kai-video-director skill's episode.json schema; load that skill first if you haven't already, this one only covers what's different for portrait.

# Nate & Kai Reel Director

Same character-engine pipeline as `nate-kai-video-director` (episode.json → OpenAI TTS + contextual gpt-image memes → rendered video), rendered with `--format reel` instead of `--format youtube`. This skill only documents what's actually different for portrait — read `nate-kai-video-director` first for the base schema, screen types, gesture reference, and render mechanics.

**Do not reuse a YouTube episode's full script for the reel.** A reel is its own tight, single-topic script, not the long-form video squeezed into a taller frame — see "One focused topic" below.

## What's different in reel

- **One focused topic, told with some depth — not a recap.** Pick the single most interesting angle in the article (the specific mechanism behind a number, not the number list) and stay on it start to finish. No side-quests into other stats the article covers — those are what the YouTube cut is for.
- **Duration: 45-55 seconds is the sweet spot — a target, not a ceiling.** Keep each line's spoken audio under ~6 seconds for the quick back-and-forth cadence. Watch out: an "exaggerated"/comedic delivery (see Tone below) runs noticeably slower per word than plain delivery — a script that hits 40s read straight can hit 55s read with real comedic timing. **Never trim content, cut a joke, or shorten a beat just to force the render under 60s** (standing instruction from Nathan, 2026-09-20 — some jokes and some real facts genuinely need the extra few seconds to land, and a rushed punchline is worse than a slightly-long reel). Write for the sweet spot as your aim, check the actual `ffprobe` duration once rendered, and if it runs long because the content earned it, leave it — don't hack lines down after the fact to hit a number. If a render comes in noticeably short (under 40s) that's a sign to add real content (another beat, another fact), not padding.
- **Default tone: high-voltage informal parody, heavy cussing, metaphor-first punchlines** (standing instruction from Nathan, 2026-09-20, updated 2026-09-20 — every reel is a distribution performance built to drive traffic to the article, not the site's own voice). The target is the energy that landed when a big official slogan collided with a brutal real-world receipt: "energy dominance" meeting a $6.285 diesel pump. That means:
  - Every reel should keep a live-wire stand-up rhythm throughout, not just one hot opening line. If a line is only exposition, rewrite it until it has a turn, a reversal, a simile, a metaphor, or a hard tag.
  - Cussing is part of the cadence: fuck/shit/damn/hell should land naturally and often, not as decoration. Avoid timid "mild swearing" unless the user explicitly asks for restraint.
  - Build jokes from the verified mechanism: the number, the policy lever, the bottleneck, the county, the crop, the contract, the receipt. The joke rides the fact; it never replaces it.
  - **Hooks must be A-material and start like an interruption.** The first spoken line in every reel needs the same level of collision as the best "energy dominance meets $6.285 diesel" joke: a famous promise, slogan, policy, or public assumption crashing into the concrete receipt. Start in a dramatic conversational register, e.g. "Yoooo, guess what the fuck," "Broooo, this shit wild," or "My ninja, you won't believe this shit:" — then land the factual hook immediately. Do not start with "Nate..." or "Kai..." unless it is part of a sharper interruption. No soft openers, no "today we're talking about," no generic headline read.
  - **Story before bit-stack.** A reel must have one clean story spine that a distracted viewer can repeat: "Trump/admin slogan or policy promise meets real-world constraint; constraint hits diesel price; diesel price hits one specific farm workflow; article reveals who may eat the bill." Do not assemble a reel as eight adjacent jokes about the same topic. Each line should answer the previous line or escalate it.
  - **Core plot engine, not literal questions.** Under the jokes, extract the article into this hidden sequence: identity -> origin -> disruption -> power response -> promised fix -> physical/economic constraint -> local impact -> unresolved bill. In plain English: define the thing, show where it comes from, show what changed, explain why leaders want to change the system, explain why "make it here" or "fix it at home" sounds attractive, reveal what reality blocks that fix, then land on who feels the effect and what the article investigates. Do not put those as direct Q&A lines unless the bit specifically calls for it; make them feel like story beats.
  - Use a simple reel structure unless there is a better article-specific one: line 1 hook, line 2 why this is happening, line 3 explain the mechanism with a metaphor, line 4 bring it home to the region/person, line 5 show the pain point, line 6 twist/complication, line 7 unresolved stakes, line 8 curiosity gap into the article. If a line could be moved anywhere without breaking the story, rewrite it.
  - Keep one recurring object/metaphor across the reel — receipt, pump, plate, red button, kitchen, courtroom — and let that object carry the viewer through the whole video. Avoid switching metaphors every line unless the switch itself is the joke.
  - If a spoken line is long or contains multiple story beats, use multiple visuals inside that line instead of letting one image sit there. Prefer splitting the line when dialogue rhythm allows it; otherwise use `screens[]` with `start_word` or `at` so the panel changes exactly when the line turns.
  - Use punchy, conversational substitutions instead of slurs. Do **not** write the n-word. If the intended casual beat wants that shape, use "my ninja" instead.
  - Prefer analogies that feel like somebody explaining the article out loud: "the pump ate the loan," "the receipt caught the farmer outside," "the refinery is the kitchen and diesel is the cooked meal." Keep the metaphor specific enough that the audience learns the system while laughing.
  - For U.S. political or policy-linked stories, do a current-source check for President Trump's relationship to the situation and include it when there is a sourced, editorially relevant connection. Use President Trump's name directly when the source supports that relationship, but keep the factual claim neutral and dated. Roast the situation, slogan, policy bind, receipt, or public contradiction; do not invent motives or facts and do not cruelly attack a real person.
  - Put the delivery direction in each line's `voice_instructions`, and put the strongest punchlines directly in the spoken text. Do not trust TTS instructions to invent the joke.
  - Ask first only if the user's request suggests they want the more restrained professional tone instead (see `nate-kai-video-director`'s tone section).
- **The dialogue builds curiosity — it is not the ad.** End on a line that makes people want to know more (a cliffhanger, "that's only half the story") rather than a direct pitch. The outro/CTA screen (already built, don't touch its mechanics) is the actual promotional beat — keep the promotion there, not in the jokes.
- **The screen is a picture-in-picture panel, not part of the camera shot.** In 16:9, the camera crops the speaking anchor and the shared screen together. In portrait that's impossible without a distant, tiny-subject wide shot (the screen sits ~900px outboard of each mark — see `camera.py`'s `REEL_PANEL_H` comment) — so reel instead composites the screen as a fixed panel across the top of frame, with the character cropped into the space below it. This is already fully built; you don't need to touch `camera.py` or `make_episode.py` to use it, just render with `--format reel` and it happens automatically for every line plus the intro/outro.
- **Use a contextual full-video background.** Add `background_meme` to each reel's `episode.json`. The image pipeline generates/crops it to the reel delivery size (`1080x1920`) and the renderer blends it behind the hosts for the entire video. Prompt it like a cinematic article environment, not a punchline panel: darkened university lab/server room, campus quad at night, hackathon workspace, startup office, data-center rack aisle, etc. depending on the article. Avoid text, logos, real public figures, and busy center details; leave the top readable behind the screen panel and the lower/middle readable behind the character.
- **No burned-in caption bar.** Reel is audio-first — only a small brand pill and footer, no karaoke-style dialogue text. Don't add one back.
- **Camera still cuts per line, favoring whoever's speaking** — inherited automatically, same push-transition as youtube. This is what gives reel the same "quick switching" feel as the 16:9 cut; nothing to configure.
- **Reuse images across script rewrites.** If you're iterating on the dialogue but a line's visual beat hasn't changed, leave that line's `screen.prompt` and `screen.path` exactly as they were — the meme generator caches by prompt, so unchanged prompts never re-hit the image API. Only write a new prompt when the actual visual concept for that line changes. (Only regenerate images when the user actually asks for new ones — "the images are fine on this one" means don't touch them.)

## Render

## Timed Screens Inside One Line

For a long hook or explanation, a line may use `screens[]` instead of `screen`:

```json
"screens": [
  { "start_word": 0, "screen": { "type": "meme", "path": ".../line01a.png", "prompt": "..." } },
  { "start_word": 7, "screen": { "type": "meme", "path": ".../line01b.png", "prompt": "..." } },
  { "start_word": 14, "screen": { "type": "meme", "path": ".../line01c.png", "prompt": "..." } }
]
```

Use this whenever one spoken line has two or more visual story turns: interruption -> factual number -> metaphor, or policy promise -> real bottleneck -> local receipt. Keep captions short and make each timed visual add information, not just novelty.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<key> USE_OPENAI_TTS=true python3 character-engine/tools/make_episode.py \
  character-engine/episodes/<slug>/episode.json --format reel
```

Everything else (caching, worker parallelism, the generation-phase timing breakdown) works exactly as documented in `nate-kai-video-director`.

**Output**: lands at `character-engine/output/reels/<slug>.mp4` — a single flat folder for every rendered reel, alongside its YouTube sibling `character-engine/output/youtube/`. Same move-not-copy behavior as the base skill: the episode folder keeps its build cache (frames/audio/QA material) but the one finished video relocates there as `make_episode.py`'s last step.

## QA — reel-specific checks

Do the base skill's QA pass, plus:

- **Screen panel** sits with real margin from the top edge, not touching it.
- **No screen bleed into the character region.** Look at the top-left and top-right corners of the character crop (just below the panel) on a few different lines/gestures — there should be nothing there but grid floor. If you see any sliver of color or a border line at those corners, the camera window is reaching into the shared screen's stage-space bounds again; that's `camera.single_shot_portrait`'s clamp (`screen_left`/`screen_right` vs `window["center_x"]`) — don't loosen it without re-verifying against both anchors' marks.
- **No caption bar anywhere.** If one appears, `build_line_overlay`'s reel branch has regressed.
- **Outro is vertically balanced** — the meme card and the CTA card should read as one centered group with roughly equal empty space above and below, not hugging the top with a big gap before the CTA card.
- **Actual duration via `ffprobe`**, aiming for the 45-55s sweet spot. If it's noticeably under 45s, that's a sign to add real content (another beat/fact), not to pad. If it runs past 60s because the jokes/facts genuinely needed the room, **that's fine — leave it.** Do not cut content or rush a punchline just to hit a duration number; a slightly-long reel that lands beats a trimmed one that doesn't.

## Sync to Google Drive

Once the render passes QA, upload it so it's reachable from every device:

```bash
rclone copy character-engine/output/reels/<slug>.mp4 "gdrive:Bot That Lyfe Website Marketing Videos/Reels/"
```

Idempotent — re-running after a re-render overwrites the same filename in Drive. Requires the `gdrive:` rclone remote (`rclone listremotes` should list it) — one-time setup per machine. This is the last step before reporting the reel finished.
