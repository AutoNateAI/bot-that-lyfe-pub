tools/generate_screen_meme.py — contextual cartoon-meme images for the shared
screen, generated with gpt-image-2.5-flare (same model/endpoint as the site's
scripts/generate-meme-images.mjs, which the meme-visual-pass skill uses to
scatter meme images through the research articles themselves).

Why this exists: screen_graphics.py's fallback for an uncited banter line with
no explicit `screen` spec used to be the branded "THE BRIEF" standby card —
correct in that it isn't a caption echoing the dialogue, but a static idle
card is dead air on a screen the audience's eye keeps going to. A contextual
meme keeps that same "always something worth looking at" guarantee without
resorting to captions, and it's actual content, not a placeholder.

v10: this used to generate at 1536x1024 and center-crop to the screen bezel's
exact aspect so it could drop in full-bleed with no letterboxing. That meant
(a) every generation paid for the model's biggest/slowest landscape size, and
(b) build_meme_card then hard-resized to the box's exact pixels — fine when
the crop had already forced the aspect to match, but the crop itself risked
trimming a caption that sat too close to the edge. Simpler now: no crop at
all — build_meme_card scales the raw generation to fit inside whatever box
it's placed in (the dialogue screen bezel, or the intro/outro card), padding
the rest with the same background every other card type uses. Never
distorted, never crops a caption.

v11: gpt-image-2.5-flare (unlike dall-e-2/gpt-image-1) isn't limited to the
three fixed size presets (1024x1024 / 1536x1024 / 1024x1536) — it accepts an
arbitrary WIDTHxHEIGHT as long as both dimensions are multiples of 16 and the
aspect ratio is between 1:3 and 3:1 (confirmed against OpenAI's current API
reference). GEN_SIZE below is computed to exactly match make_stage.SCREEN_W /
SCREEN_H's 1.625:1 ratio — the box most of these drop into — so a v10-style
square generation no longer needs a big pillarbox to fit it; it also happens
to be fewer total pixels than 1024x1024, so this isn't a size/speed
trade-off, just a better-fitting shape for the same cost. The intro/outro
cards are a wider box (~2.3:1) and will still pillarbox some — one GEN_SIZE
for every job keeps this simple; a future version could pass a per-job size
if that gap is worth closing.

Usage:
    python3 tools/generate_screen_meme.py --manifest jobs.json
    python3 tools/generate_screen_meme.py --prompt "..." --out path/to/file.png

Manifest shape: a JSON array of {"out": "<path>", "prompt": "<...>"} objects.
Paths are resolved relative to the current working directory if not absolute.
Jobs run in parallel (like the .mjs sibling's Promise.allSettled) — one bad
prompt doesn't sink the batch.

Caching: writes a "<out>.json" sidecar recording {model, quality, prompt}. A
re-run with the same prompt for the same output path is a no-op unless
--force is passed — episode re-renders (which call screen_content_for_line
every frame) never need to hit the API twice for the same line.
